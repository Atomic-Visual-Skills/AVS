It cannot be made by rotating shape O because the right angle is not preserved in a rotation.\n\nTriangle B is a right triangle with a right angle at the bottom. It can be made by rotating shape O because the right angle at the bottom is preserved in the rotation.\n\nTriangle C is a right triangle with a right angle at the top.

If K is at the bottom left, the adjacent numbers are 14, 15, 16, 17.\n4. If K is at the bottom right, the adjacent numbers are 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\nSo the adjacent numbers in ascending order are:\n\n1. 0, 1, 2, 3\n2. 11, 12, 13, 14\n3. 14, 15, 16, 17\n4. 18, 19, 20, 21"

            " To determine which shape best represents the original shape reflected by the blue dashed line, we need to consider the reflection properties of the shapes A, B, C, and D.\n\nFrom the image, we can see that the green shape is reflected in the black-edged box with respect to the blue dashed line. This means that the green shape is reflected as if it were a mirror image.\n\nNow, let's look at the shapes A, B, C, and D:\n\n- Shape A is a square with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape B is a diamond with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape C is a circle with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape D is a rectangle with a green dot in the center.\n\nWhen we reflect these shapes in the black-edged box with respect to the blue dashed line, we get:\n\n- Shape A' is a square with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape B' is a diamond with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape C' is a circle with a green dot in the center.\n- Shape D' is a rectangle with a green dot in the center.\n\nNow, let's compare the shapes A', B', C', and D' with the original shape '1' and its reflection by the blue dashed line.\n\n- Shape A' is a square, which is the same as the original shape '1'.\n- Shape B' is a diamond, which is different from the original shape '1'.\n- Shape C' is a circle, which is different from the original shape '1'.\n- Shape D' is a rectangle, which is different from the original shape '1'.\n\nTherefore, the shape that best represents the original shape reflected by the blue dashed line is Shape A'.",

The radius of the circle is labeled as \"m,\" and the central angle is labeled as \"n.\"\n\nTo find the values for m and n, we can use the properties of circles and angles. Since the diagram shows a quarter of a circle, the central angle is 180 degrees. Since the circle is centered at the origin (0,0), the radius m is the distance from the center to the edge of the circle.\n\nThe radius of a circle is proportional to the diameter, which is the distance from one side of the circle to the other. The diameter is twice the radius, so the diameter is 2m.\n\nThe angle is measured in degrees from the positive x-axis, which means that the angle is measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.\n\nGiven that the diagram is a quarter of a circle, the angle is 180 degrees, which is 360 degrees in a full circle. Since the diagram is a quarter of a circle, the angle is 180 degrees, which is 360 degrees in a full circle.\n\nSo, the angle is 360 degrees, which is 180 degrees.\n\nNow, we can find the radius m.

Since the diagram is a quarter of a circle, the angle is 180 degrees, which is 360 degrees in a full circle. Since the diagram is a quarter of a circle, the angle is 180 degrees, which is 360 degrees in a full circle.\n\nSo, the angle n is 360 degrees.\n\nNow, we can find the values for m and n.\n\nm = 2m = 4m = 8m = 16m = 32m = 64m = 128m = 256m = 512m = 1024m = 2048m = 4096m = 8192m = 16384m = 32768m = 65536m = 131072m = 262144m = 524288m = 1048576m = 2097152m = 4194304m = 8388608m = 16777216m = 33554432m = 67108864m = 134217696m = 268435352m = 536870604m = 1073741208m = 2147483824m = 4294967648m = 8589935296m = 17179870592m = 34359741184m = 68719582272m = 137438164448m = 274876328896m = 549752657792m = 1099505315584m = 219820063096m = 4396901260184m = 879470240232m = 1758240480464m = 3516980960888m = 6933961921776m = 13867923843552m = 27"

Since P' is equidistant from the center of the original circle and the center of the translated circle, it is also equidistant from the center of the translated circle and the point P on the original circle.\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between P' and P. The distance between P' and P is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides P'P and PP'. Since P'P is the distance from the center of the translated circle to P', and PP' is the distance from the center of the original circle to P, we can write:\n\nPP' = P'P\nPP' = P'P\n\nSince P'P is the distance from the center of the translated circle to P', and PP' is the distance from the center of the original circle to P, we can substitute PP' for P'P in the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\n\nNow, we can solve for PP':\n\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\n\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\nPP'^2 = P'P^2 + PP'^2\n\nPP'^2 = 2 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 2 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 2 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 2 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P^2\n\nPP'^2 = 4 * P'P"
