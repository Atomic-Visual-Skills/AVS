        "question": "In the picture, a red dot and five arrows labeled A, B, C, D, and E are drawn. Each arrow points in a clockwise or counterclockwise orientation with respect to the red dot. Among arrows A, B, C, D and E, which arrow is most likely to point in an orientation distinct from the others?",
        "answer": "A",
        "skill": "clockwise",
        "difficulty": "easy",
        "model_answer": "The arrow labeled A is most likely to point in an orientation distinct from the others. This is because the red dot is located at the center of the hexagon, and the other arrows are pointing towards the red dot, which is the center of the hexagon. The other arrows are pointing in different directions, which indicates that they are not pointing towards the red dot."
